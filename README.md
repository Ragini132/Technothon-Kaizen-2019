# Technothon-Kaizen-2019
# Project Title: Nation-Wide Agricultural League
## Overview:
+ Presently, major problems faced by Indian agriculture are cropping pattern, average size of land holdings, production techniques and instability in production due to changing weather.
+ Our project is aimed at solving issues that concern with the small size of land holdings and improper production techniques. 
+ The above mentioned problem can be inculcated by bringing all small scale farmers, having lands adjacent to each other. Further, all of them will be suggested to come together and join in their land to form a large piece of land.
+ Addition, to that a study of the soil quality, moisture content using moisturiser sensor and temperature sensor with machine learning algorithm for predicting the right crop and correct amount of water required in different parts of the field.

## Problem statement:
+ Sub-Division and fragmentation of land holdings: Due to the growth of population and break­down of the joint family system, there has occurred continuous sub-division of agricultural land into smaller plots. With smaller size of holdings cultivation becomes uneconomic.
+ Such sub-division and fragmentation make the efficient use of land virtually impossible and add to the difficulties of increasing capital equip­ment on the farm. All these factors account for the low productivity of Indian agriculture.
+ Further, due to unavailability of proper knowledge, regarding how to effectively use the available resources (neglection of crop rotation, inadequate use of manures and fertilisers, use of poor quality seeds, inadequate use of efficient farm equipment) further reduces the productivity.

## Target Audience:
+ This system would directly work towards the betterment of Indian farmers and workers in the agricultural field and would indirectly help in growth and development of India as agriculture sector is one of the major contributors in GDP.
## Project Objective:
+ We are planning to build a web application that will locate all farmers with small land holdings.They’ll asked to work collectively in their adjacent land holdings.
+ Further, keeping the quality of soil of all land holdings in mind, best crops suitable for the field will be suggested. Finally at the time of revenue distribution, the profit will be distributed among the farmers in the ratio of the their land holdings.
+ After harvesting the crop, the farmers will get information regarding nearby available markets for selling their produce, depending upon those selections the transport management system will come into play wherein they’ll be able to avail transport facilities between their  farmlands and desired market of their choice.
+ Combining data from the moisturiser sensor and temperature sensor with machine learning algorithm to determine the the amount of water required in different parts of the field.
